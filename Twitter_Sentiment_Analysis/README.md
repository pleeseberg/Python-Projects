# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a model to classify the sentiment of text data, such as reviews or tweets. The objective is to classify text into sentiment categories (positive, negative, or neutral) using machine learning techniques. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Requirements

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - **Dataset:** Sentiment140 in CSV format.
   - **Text Preprocessing:** Use NLTK and SpaCy for tasks including tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - **Convert Text to Numerical Features:** Implement techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF using Python libraries.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - **Model Selection:** Consider models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
   - **Training:** Fit the selected model on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation and Tuning:**
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.

5. **Deployment and Visualization:**
   - **Deployment:** Save the trained model for future use.
   - **Visualization:** Create plots or charts to illustrate model performance and insights.

6. **Documentation and Sharing:**
   - **Document Work:** Write a detailed report or create a presentation outlining the project methodology, results, and insights.
   - **Share Project:** Upload code and documentation to a repository for public access.

## File Structure

- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, outlines the requirements, and explains how to execute the data processing and model tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required for the Python data processing and machine learning tasks.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file `sentiment140.csv`.
- `src/`: Directory containing Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Goals

- **Data Collection:** Obtain the Sentiment140 dataset and perform initial preprocessing.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenize, normalize, and clean text data to prepare for feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction:** Convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train sentiment classification models, evaluate their performance, and tune hyperparameters.
- **Visualization:** Visualize model performance and insights through plots and charts.
- **Documentation:** Document the process and results, and share the project on a repository.
